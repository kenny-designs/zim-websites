<h3>Welcome to the final lecture</h3>

<p>
We did it everyone! Congrats! Today is the last lecture. GLHF with the final.
</p>

<h3>Final Notes</h3>

<p>
10 questions on the test. As per the midterm, the questions will be padded from the HW. Welcome to bring a 2-page cheatsheet. 2 hours and 30 minutes. Begin at 6:00. The final will be in the assignments section. <b>The absolute deadline is at 8:30! </b>Exam is only on the stuff from the midterm onwards. He says we might not need MARS on hand. I suggest just doing all the HW questions again. Take pics of handwritten work.
</p>

<h3>Chapter 7: Input/Output Systems</h3>

<p>
Understand how I/O systems work, including I/O methods and architectures.<br>
Become familiar with storage media, and the differences in their respective formats.<br>
Understand how <b>RAID</b> improves disk performance and reliability, and which RAId systems are most useful today.<br>
Be familiar with emerging data storage technologies and the barriers that remain to be overcome.
</p>

<p>
Data storage and retrieval is one of the primary functions of computer systems.<br>
One could say that computers are more useful to us as data storage and retrieval devices than they are as computational machines.<br>
All computers have I/O devices connected to them.<br>
To achieve good performance I/O should be kept to a minmum!
</p>

<p>
Sluggish I/O throughput can have a ripple effect, dragging down overall system performance.<br>
This is espescially true when virtual memory is involved.<br>
<i>The fastest processor in the world is of little use if it spends most of its time waiting for data!</i>
</p>

<h3>Amdahl's Law</h3>

<p>
The overall performance of a system is a result of the interaction of all of its components.<br>
System performance is most effectively improved when the performance of the most heavily used components is improved.<br>
This idea is quantified by <b>Amdahl's Law!</b>
</p>

<p>
S = 1 / ( (1 - f) + (f / k))<br>
Where S is the overall speedup;<br>
f is the faction of work performed by a faster component;<br>
and k is the speedup of the faster component.<br>
<b>Calculating k is initially not intuitive!</b><br>
Only possibility of a speedup is if f is greater than 1.
</p>

<p>
On a large system, suppose we can<br>
<ul>
<li>upgrade a CPU to make it 50% faster for $10,000 or</li>
<li>upgrade its disk drive for $7,000 to make them 150% faster.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Processes spend 70% of their time running in the CPU and 30% of their time waiting for disk service.<br>
An upgrade of which component would offer the greater benefit for the lesser cost?<br>
Between the two, CPU is being used the most where else we hardly touch the disk drive. Therefore, we can try and calculate which is better.
</p>

<h3>Calculating K - The Speedup</h3>

<p>
The new CPU is 50% faster than the old CPU.<br>
Restated: The new CPU is 1.5 times faster than the old CPU.<br>
So, in this case K = 1.5.
</p>

<p>
The new disk drive is 150% faster than the old one.<br>
Restated: The new disk drive is 2.5 times faster than the old one.<br>
So, in this case : = 2.5
</p>

<p>
Using the formula above, the processor option offers a 30% speedup.<br>
So, Each 1% of improvement for the processor costs $333 ($10,000 / 30)
</p>

<p>
The disk drive option gives a 22% speedup.<br>
So, each 1% of improvement for the disk costs $318. ($7,000 / 22).
</p>

<p>
Numbers alone, <b>we see that the disk drive is better for the price!</b>
</p>

<p>
There are other factors to consider our professor says. The actual values of CPU and disk service can vary over time. Reliability is an issue. Etc.
</p>

<h3>Architectures</h3>

<p>
We define input/output as a subsystem of components that moves coded data between external devices and a host system.
</p>

<p>
I/O subsystems include:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Blocks of main memory</b> that are devoted to I/O functions.</li>
<li><b>Buses </b>that move data into and out of the system.</li>
<li><b>Control modules</b> in the host and in peripheral devices.</li>
<li><b>Interfaces to external components</b> such as keyboards and disks.</li>
<li><b>Cabling or communications links</b> between the host system and its peripherals.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I/O can be controlled in five general ways:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Programmed I/O</b> reserves a register for each I/O device. Each register is continually polled to detect data arrival.</li>
<li><b>Interrupt-Driven I/O </b>allows the CPU to do other things until I/O is requested.</li>
<li><b>Memory-Mapped I/O</b> shares memory address space between I/O devices and program memory.</li>
<li><b>Direct Memory Access</b> (DMA) offloads I/O processing to a special-purpose chip that takes care of the details.</li>
<li><b>Channel I/O </b>uses dedicated I/O processors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In a system that uses interrupts, the status of the interrupt signal is checked at the top of the <b>fetch-decode-execute</b> cycle.<br>
The particular code that is executed whenever an interrupt occurs is determined by a set of addresses called <b>interrupt vectors</b> that are stored in low memory.<br>
The system state is saved before the interrupt service routine is executed and is restored afterward.
</p>

<h3>Memory-Mapped I/O</h3>

<p>
In a memory-mapped I/O, devices and main memory share the same address space.<br>
<ul>
<li>Each I/O device has its own reserved block of memory.</li>
<li>Memory-mapped I/O therefore looks just like a memory access from the point of view of the CPU.</li>
<li>Thus the same instructions to move data to and from both I/O and memory, greatly simplifying system design.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In small systems, the low-level details of the data transfers are offloaded to the I/O controllers built into the I/O devices.
</p>

<h3>Direct Memory Access</h3>

<p>
DMA and the CPU share the same bus.<br>
The DMA runs at a <b>higher priority</b> and <b>steals memory cycles from the CPU!</b><br>
<b>Cycle Stealing</b> is a method of accessing computer memory or bus without interfering with the CPU. It is similar to direct memory access for allowing I/O controllers to read or write RAM without CPU intervention.
</p>

<h3>Channel I/O</h3>

<p>
Very large systems employ channel I/O<br>
Channel I/O consists of one or more I/O processors (IOPs) that control various channel paths.<br>
Slower devices such as terminals and printers are combined (multiplexed) into a single faster channel.<br>
On IBM mainframes, multiplexed channels are called <b>multiplexor channels</b>, the faster ones are called <b>selector channels.</b>
</p>

<p>
Channel I/O is distinguished from DMA by the <b>intelligence of the IOPs.</b><br>
The IOP negotiates protocols, issues device commands, translates storage coding to memory coding, and can transfer entire files or groups of files independent of the host CPU.<br>
The host has only to create the program instructions for the I/O operation and tell the IOP where to find them.
</p>

<h3>Character and Block I/O</h3>

<p>
<b>Character I/O</b> devices process one byte (or character) at a time.<br>
<ul>
<li>Examples include modems, keyboards, and mice.</li>
<li><i>Keyboards are usually connected through an interrupt-driven I/O system.</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Block I/O</b> devices handle bytes in groups.<br>
<ul>
<li>Most mass storage devices (disk and tape) are block I/O devices.</li>
<li>Block I/O systems are most efficiently connected through DMA or channel I/O.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>I/O Busses</h3>

<p>
I/O buses, unlike memory buses, operate <i>asynchronously. </i>Requests for bus access must be arbitrated among the devices involved.<br>
Bus control lines activate the devices when they are needed, raise signals when errors have occurred, and reset devices when necessary.<br>
The <b>number of data lines</b> is the <b>width</b> of the bus.<br>
A <b>bus clock</b> coordinates activites and provides bit cell boundaries.
</p>

<h3>Serial Vs Parallel Data Transmission</h3>

<p>
Bytes can be conveyed from one point to another.<br>
<ul>
<li>by sending their encoding signals simultaneously using <b>parallel data transmission</b> or</li>
<li>by sending them one bit at a time in <b>serial data transmission</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In a parallel data transmission, the interface requires <b>one conductor for each bit.</b><br>
Parallel cables are fatter than serial cables.<br>
Compared with parallel data interfaces, serial communications interfaces:<br>
<ul>
<li>Require fewer conductors.</li>
<li>Are less susceptible to attenuation.</li>
<li>Can transmit data farther and faster.</li>
</ul>
Serial communications interfaces are suitable for time-sensitive (<i>isochronous) </i>data such as voice and video.
</p>

<h3>Disk Technology</h3>

<p>
Magnetic disks offer large amounts of durable storage that can be accessed quickly<br>
Disk drives are called <i>random (or direct) </i>access storage devices, because blocks of data can be accessed according to their location on the disk.<br>
<ul>
<li>This term was coined when all other durable storage (e.g., tape) was sequential.</li>
</ul>
Magnetic disk organization is shown on the following slide.
</p>

<p>
<b>See the hard drive in action:</b><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtPc0jI21i0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtPc0jI21i0" class="https">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtPc0jI21i0</a>
</p>

<h3>Rigid Disk Drives</h3>

<p>
Disk tracks are numbered from the outside edge, starting with zero. <br>
Hard disk platters are mounted on spindles.<br>
Read/write heads are mounted on a comb that swings radially to read the disk.<br>
The rotating disk forms a logical cylinder beneath the read/write heads.<br>
Data blocks are addressed by their cylinder, surface, and sector.<br>
There are a number of <i>electromechanical</i> properties of hard disk drives that determine how fast its data can be accessed.<br>
<b>Seek time</b> is the time that it takes for a disk arm to move into position over the desired cylinder.<br>
<b>Rotational delay</b> is the time that it takes for the desired sector to move into position beneath the read/write head.<br>
<b>Seek time + rotational delay = access time!</b>
</p>

<p>
Low cost is the major advantage of hard disks.<br>
But their limitations include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Very slow compared to main memory</li>
<li>fragility</li>
<li>moving parts wear out</li>
</ul>
Reductions in memory cost enable the widespread adoption of <b>solid state drives (SSDs).</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Computers "see" SSDs as just another disk drive, but they store data in non-volatile <i>flash</i> memory circuits.</li>
<li>Flash memory is also found in memory sticks and MP3 players.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Solid State Drives</h3>

<p>
SSD access time and transfer rates are <i>typically 100 times faster than magnetic disk, </i>but <b>slower than onboard RAM by a factor of 100,000.</b><br>
<ul>
<li>There numbers vary widely among manufacturers and interface methods.</li>
</ul>
Unlike RAM, flash is block-addressable (like disk drives).<br>
The duty cycle of flash is between 30,000 and 1,000,000 updates to a block.<br>
Updates are spread over the entire medium through <i>wear levling</i>to prolong the life of the SSD.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) </i>sets standards for SSD performance and reliability metrics. The most important are:<br>
<b>Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER) </b>measures disk reliability<br>
<b>UBER </b>is calculated by dividing the number of data errors by the number of bits read using a simulated lifetime workload.<br>
<b>TeraBytes Written (TBW). TBW </b>measures disk endurance (or service life)<br>
<b>TBW </b>is the number of terabytes that can be written to the disk before the disk fails to meet specifications for speed and error rates.

<h3>Optical Disks</h3>

<p>
Optical disks provide large storage capacities very inexpensively.<br>
They come in a number of varieties including CD-ROM, DVD, and WORM.<br>
Many large computer installations produce document output on optical disk rather than on paper. This idea is called <b>COLD — Computer Output Laser Disk.</b><br>
It is estimated that optical disks can endure <b>for a hundred years.</b> Other media are good for only <b>a decade</b> — at best.
