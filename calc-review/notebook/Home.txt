==== Intro ====
During the summer of 2020, I will be taking Multivariable Calculus. It has been about a year since I've taken Calc 2. As such, I am in desperate need to review. This website is dedicated to that review!

Calculus in itself is very dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities.

//Integral Calculus// deals with area.
//Differential Calculus// deals with limits.
