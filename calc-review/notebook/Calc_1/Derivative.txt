====== Derivative ======

Welcome to a very exciting part of calculus! The derivative.

Building off of what we learned in the [[Limits]] section, limits of the form
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
arise whenever we calculate a rate of change in any of the sciences or engineering, such as a rate of reaction in chemistry or a marginal cost in economics. Since this type of limit occurs so widely, it is given a special name and notation.

The **derivative of a function f at a number a, **denoted by {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}, is
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
if this limit exists.

If we write x = a + h, then we have h = x - a and h approaches 0 if and only if x approaches a. Therefore an equivalent way of stating the definition of the derivative, as we saw in finding tangent lines, is
{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

As an aside, if we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation of the tangent line to the curve y = //f(x)// at the point (a, //f(a))// like so:
{{./equation004.png?type=equation}}

The **instantaneous rate of change** is equal to:
{{./equation005.png?type=equation}}
We recognize this limit as being the derivative //f'(x//_{1}).

To recap, the derivative //f'(a)// is the instantaneous rate of change of y = //f(x)// with respect to x when x = a.

==== Derivative Notations ====
If we use the traditional notation y = //f(x)// to indicate that the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y, then some common alternative notations for the derivative are as follow:
{{./equation006.png?type=equation}}
The symbols D and d/dx are called **differentiation operators** because they indicate the operation of **differentiation**, which is the process of calculating a derivative.

The symbol dy/dx, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a ratio (for the time being); it is simply a synonym for //f'(x). //Nonetheless, it is a very useful and suggestive notation, especailly when used in conjunction with increment notation.

A function //f// is **differentiable at a** if //f'(a)// exists. It is **differentiable on an open interval** (a, b) [or {{./equation007.png?type=equation}}] if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.

If //f// is differentiable at a, then //f//is continuous at a.

We can go even further beyond a single derivative! //(f')' = f''//. This new function //f''// is called the **second derivative** of //f// because it is the derivative of the derivative of f.

==== Differentiation Rules ====
The formula we use for finding derivatives is useful but quite tedious and painfully slow. As such, there are various rules we can use to speed up this process! These rules are used heavily all throughout calc 1 and calc 2 so get them down really well.

**Derivative of a Constant Function**
{{./equation008.png?type=equation}}

**Power Rule (General Version)**
If n is a //any real number//, then
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}}

**The Constant Multiple Rule**
If c is a constant and //f// is a differentiable function, then
{{./equation011.png?type=equation}}

**The Sum Rule**
If //f// and //g// are both differentiable, then
{{./equation012.png?type=equation}}

**The Difference Rule**
If //f// and //g// are both differentiable, then
{{./equation013.png?type=equation}}

**Definition of the Number e**
//e// is a pretty special boy. It is a number such that
{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}

**Derivative of the Natural Exponential Function**
{{./equation015.png?type=equation}}

**The Product Rule**
If //f// and //g// are both differentiable, then
{{./equation016.png?type=equation}}

In prime notation, it looks like this: {{./equation017.png?type=equation}}

**The Quotient Rule**
If //f// and //g// are differentiable, then
{{./equation018.png?type=equation}}

In prime notation, we have:
{{./equation019.png?type=equation}}

One way to remember this is //low dee high, high dee low. //Low refers to the denominator and high the numerator. The dee refers to taking the derivative.
