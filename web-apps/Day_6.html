Created Thursday 13 February 2020
</p>

<p>
As a side note, professor gave <a href="https://phaser.io/" title="https://phaser.io/" class="https">https://phaser.io/</a> the okay.
</p>

<p>
The reason he taught us scheme was to force us to learn how to quickly pick up a new language from scratch. Scheme is rather foreign so that worked well.
</p>

<p>
Also, the major objective of us working on the game is that we need to learn to all work together.
</p>

<p>
<b>If it aint documented, it aint!</b> That's today's maxim. If it's not in writing then it never happened.
</p>

<p>
Today, let's talk about scale. Let's say you're working with 100 people. The software itself must be written in java 8.0. That's how we're gonna release it. Let's say some people were out when you announced this. Flu, had a baby, etc. You don't even know they weren't there!
</p>

<p>
How do they know? <b>Write it down on a piece of paper.</b> Something everyone is required to read over. Everyone will read your memo and should know. This may sounds trivial but it's of major importance. This is why large projects always move considerably slower than small groups that don't document. However, what happens when you don't document? Real world example: Programmer working on a project but didn't document anything. When they requested documentation, it was too late. The programmer was dead (unrelated to the project). All that our professor and colleagues could find was a flowchart with some flaws in it.
</p>

<p>
Professor is now going over what happened with the Challenger rocket. A gaskget was too cold and ended up causing the rocket to explode. However, it was not an engineering issue. It was <b>a management issue!</b> Due to the documentation, they were able to realize that it wasn't the engineers at fault. In fact, they were warning management but they didn't listen.
</p>

<p>
<b>CYA</b> - Cover Your Ass
</p>

<p>
Document everything. Use version control to keep a running log. (Google docs isn't a good way to keep documentation. Can't sort by date. <b>It's up to QA to document everything.</b>)
</p>

<p>
By the way, cool fact: All of the best 500 super computers in the world <i>run on linux.</i> 
</p>

<p>
Now then, how do we construct large structures from small ones? It starts with source code. The next step is to hand it to a compiler (machines can't execute human readable code afterall. It needs it in machine language). What do you get from a compiler? Not assembly code. Let's so that was already done. You get machine code as a .obj file. An object file.
</p>

<p>
Now then, what is <i>printf</i>? Not what it does. Now then, the compiler doesn't know. What happens now is a <b>linkage editor </b>(there are other terms but our professor prefers this one). It links the object files to create an executable program. A .exe. To do this, the linker goes to search a variety of libraries and combines the .objs into a .exe file. The .exe has most of the code that's going to be executed but not all of it. Why not all of it? That's because some programs are used so frequently that they are resident. There's no need to include it in the .exe. As such, we simply leave a warning that the connection is going to have to be made.
</p>

<p>
Next, after the .exe, we have a <b>loader.</b> A ld. This fixes up addresses to account for holes. The loaders connects us to resident programs/code. It connects them all together. <b>And now we have something that can be executed!</b>
</p>

<p>
What we need to look at is a program that controls the course code, obj, and linking (or mabe he pointed to the exe. close enough). We could do it manually but it's difficult. As such, <b>we make use of a program called make.</b> The IDE <b>does not</b> make use of it. It uses some version of it such as maven but it's doing the job that make does. We'll be looking more into this next week.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>
As you work on a program, have you ever noticed that you keep copies of your code just in case you might mess everything up. People noticed this so they used <b>RCS - </b>revision control system. Keeps a generation number to a file. Everytime you save a file, it increments the generation number. However, it takes up a bunch of space! And this was during a time where space was extra limited. Not to forget to mention that programs could get very large. We had no indexing either. It got pretty messy.
</p>

<p>
As a result, we invented <b>CVS.</b> It collected all files dealing with a project in one place. A repo. Second, it did a hell of a job squeezing files. Base changes + delta -&gt; current version. Given the power of our machines, this worked well. However, CVS makes you deal with your project file by file. This can be painful when you have a ton of files or only want the ones in one particular directory. CVS is still used in some places but some folk got together and said <b>let's do it directory by directory.</b> You likely don't just want a single file but everything within the directory. Disk space is cheap now so who cares?
</p>

<p>
<b>Subversion.</b> Subversion works on directories. You could force it to work on single files such as with remote services. (btw, our homework will be based on subversion. Use the CLI). Now then, Linux Torvalds wasn't having a good time with subversion. Working remotely was difficult. All sorts of conflicts arose when trying to merge things. He tried the propriety bitkeeper but didn't like it. As such, he invented good 'ol <b>GIT.</b>
</p>

<p>
As of now, subversion and git are the two primary version control systems that we use. Note, these two aren't ran so well in the field. <b>GUI and commercial services are trash.</b> Don't use them. Do you know how often github backups? What if it had a head crash? You know about your directories but what about others? Are they important! Damn right they are! Commercial services will keep this info from you. You're gonna need to know what the individual directories of subversion are.
</p>

<p>
MySpace, for example, didn't back up it's data at all. 13 years of data now gone!
</p>

<p>
Now then, to the homework. We'll be using subversion. It's a little harder than git. However, subversion is prefered when you have good communication. Everyone sees eachother everyday, constant talking etc. Git is good for when communication or flaky or weak satellite links. There do exist some commercial version control systems. Some good some terrible.
</p>

<p>
Instructions:<br>
1) Google the following, "the subversion book."  Read 1.7 <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" title="here" class="http">here</a>. Paper copies also available but it's a waste.<br>
2) Read the intro and go to the quickstart section<br>
3) Create a repo<br>
4) Put something in the repo. A file, souce file, ASCII, etc.<br>
5) Get your file back<br>
6) Modify the file<br>
7) Return it to the repo
</p>

<p>
He doesn't know how long the reading will take but the assignment itself is an 30min to 1 hour. <b>NO GUI! NO TORTOISE ON WINDOWS!</b> CLI only. It'll be fun! Unix will be the comfiest.
</p>

<p>
<b>By the way, the indentation is meaningful!</b> I'm not sure what that means but do it.
</p>

<p>
<b>How do we submit?</b> Get a transcript of your terminal session. Use the <i>script</i> command.
</p>

<h3>Homework for Specs</h3>

<p>
You need to find the IEEE website for specifications. You don't need to do every little thing. A fragment is fine and don't pay the IEEE.
</p>

<p>
Specs is a little weird. It works sorta in bits and pieces. Before you start a project, you'd usually talk to the stake holders. They're idiots. Paper pushers. As such, who knows what's actually required? <b>Who knows what they need to have?</b> The answer: <i>the end user.</i> The best info you're going to get about the functioning of a program is the end user. For this semester's game, the people we are making it for is us! We're the end users. However, in the real world the end user won't know all that technical stuff. Keep it simple. As in, <i>this is what the screen should look like! </i>That's a perfectly reasonable way to do things. Heck, even a screenshot will do. Make it real easy to understand what the code is about.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Talk to the end user.<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> More is better. The more detail the specs contain the better.
</p>

<p>
Imagine this scenario, you need nuts and bolts. You order them. Takes a day or two. You get them and send them to where they need to be. But oh no! Turns out, the dimensions were wrong. The spec was incorrect.
