Now for the second half of where we left off from the last lecture (I'm so excited I gave our professor a like and a sub. Actually, I really hope he doesn't see all the lofi hiphop and OneyNG lets play videos I've been watching...)
</p>

<p>
The video can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/5aruFog2njE" title="here" class="https">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
A number of super computers could be found throughout the country and people wanted to access them without having to travel to the machines. By this point, we have excellent time sharing (IBM finally got on it and GE provided great leadership in doing time sharing. Very robust system. Hella good. Worked well for quite some time.) We also had inexpensive terminals. Now is the time to overcome the transit time problem. We need to communicate rapidly between the remote graphic terminal and the local super computer CPU. Quite the challenge he says.
</p>

<p>
One way we handled this was with dedicated lines. Pay some big bucks and you're set (many people were <i>not</i> set).
</p>

<p>
Luckily, a little company invented t3h <b>internets!</b> (That typo in the word 'the' was both intentional and a homage on my part to the rather cringy early days of internet memes.)
</p>

<p>
Now then, we need a connection between a CPU and the terminal at home. How do we connect the two? How do we get reliable highspeed communication without dedicated lines? At least, lets you share dedicated lines with other people thus spreading the high cost of them? The answer was <b>TCP/IP </b>(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) or, as he put it, an <i>internet. </i>TCP/IP is how we get messages over an internet.
</p>

<p>
Built into TCP/IP is <i>reliability.</i> If any part of the network is down, the routers will route packets around the failed portion of the networks. High speed too! Plus, no transit time problems! By using an internet, we are going to disconnect the timing between the CPU and terminal completely! <i>Huh? Yeah. </i>(Big smug energy this man has)
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the line can actually handle all the data that the CPU can dish out, at any given time the CPU may output a bunch of frames on a cube and eventually go out and be seen on the CRT monitor. Not only will they be received, a lot of checking is done to make sure that it was done properly. It works well but there are some issues that you should see immediately.
</p>

<p>
Let's say that you want to interact with the CPU through your keyboard. How does the CPU know you pressed a key? <b>Ah jeez problems!</b>
</p>

<p>
Xerox has set out to create a paperless office. How do they do this? One of the things they noticed, you couldn't do everything from the keyboard. People used to joke that the primary requirement of becoming a CEO of a fortune whatevers company is an IQ below 70. Instead of reading and typing instructions, we want users to look at pictures and cartoons that they could understand! (Hopefully...)
</p>

<p>
So, we got cartoons now. How do we select them? We could use light pens (look it up. literally just a pen you press against a screen like some fancy schmancy wacom tablet). They were expensive and difficult to program though. So, somebody at Xerox came up with an elegant solution. Because of what it looked like, it became known as a <s>sperm cell</s> <b>a mouse </b>(he could have drawn it a little less... Anyways).
</p>

<p>
If you press a button on the mouse, the CPU could react to that as a way of selecting a picture/icon on the screen. Now we have a problem though... What happens if you press a button on the mouse over at your CRT a hundred miles out make the CPU do something?
</p>

<p>
People at Xerox worked hard on figuring out how to get these signals back and forth. Who the hell wants to run such a long line between them...
</p>

<p>
They had a graduate student from MIT who came up with the W windows systems. A little company called <b>Apple</b> got wind of this as well. They worked on it. Their initial attempts at graphics failed. On the east coast though, MIT got involved. They put together a consortium of MIT, Digital Equipment Incorporation, and the Techtronics Corporation (they made very high quality oscilloscope and whatnot). They developed a system called the <b>X Windows system. </b>Why X? Cause W, X, Y, Z (from my time spent with graphics programming, these are fundamental components of a vector for doing, well, graphics stuff!)
</p>

<p>
They knew they need to have someway to have signals from the mouse go to the CPU and come back from far, far away. They insisted that graphics software be divided into two parts: On the CPU, we would have a program called the <b>client</b> that is going to ask for graphics to be displayed somewhere. It will send that request over the internet (TCP/IP) to a corressponding software over on your server. It's a bit backwards having the Client being at the CPU and the Server being at the remote terminal. It's not too crazy though. We have a big powerful program on our CPU that can deal with lots of big pictures. Then, the server (our CRT) will display it.
</p>

<p>
The program on the CPU (Client) says, "I wanna draw pictures! Tell me where I can draw them" and the Server said, "this buffer empty. Yeet!". Well, more like, "yeah, let's do this". 
</p>

<p>
One of the nice things about this approach keeps the graphics display code us at user level. <i>It doesn't require system permission.</i> There's no interference with the operating system (mostly. Everybody asks for some system services). The point is that it can't cause trouble. It's at the user level.
</p>

<p>
Now then, over the CPU we have library code. It must know how to format requests for service from the Server. Similarly, the Server has to know how to deal with those requests for service. And we need to make life a little easier for the programmer.
</p>

<p>
20:19 he does the switcharoo thing with the camera.
</p>

<p>
Over at the CPU, designers created a <b>loop.</b> That loop spent all of its time sending out requests to the remote terminal. It asked, "do you have messages?". While the CPU kept asking if the remote terminal has anything to say (such as, have you picked up anything from the keyboard? What about mouse clicks? C'mon, give me something!). Also, the CPU also says, "By the way, here are a couple of frames for you to display". This is all done over TCP/IP of course. No worry about transit time <i>so long as our machines are fast enough and the connection is fast enough to handle the volume of traffic. </i>We have a system that works. <b>This is the basic architecture of what is known as the X-Window system.</b> And it works very nicely he says.
</p>

<p>
The designers even got clever enough to stick this inside a single machine! It didn't require a remote internet connection. If you look carefully inside your computer, you'll find that a local network exists strictly inside your computer! If you don't believe him, what is the addres 127.0.0.1? That's your computer ya dummy! We can have <b>both</b> the client and server on the same machine! This was originally implemented in Unix. Unix was a good platform and worked quite well. The guys at MIT wrote up the code but the code was very object oriented despite working in C (which, might I add, is <b>not</b> an OOP language like in C++!). They were very clever about how they implemented objects and how they got them to work.
</p>

<p>
The systems programmer doesn't care much about what is gonna be drawn or what the CPU is gonna do. So long as this loop continues, it's up to the user to provide frames to deliever and process messages that come back. 
</p>

<p>
He states that we should recognize something very interesting here. Processing on the server is completely separate from that on the client. We can't do something like getChar() because the CPU isn't directly connected to the display unit! As such, we need specially written code on the Server to capture keyboard messages and mouse clicks then package them for delievery over to the CPU. We also need special code on the Server to display graphics. 
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the term <b>listener? </b>This is why there are listeners in Java! Because they are handling graphics even inside your machine! There are two separate machines within your machine! In order to get keyboard data to the processor, we need special code embedded in the listener. On the output side, we need to be helpful to programmers. 
</p>

<p>
Graphics programming is not easy. In fact, its very messy so we need all the help we can get. We start with a simple definition: A Window<b> is simply an area on the screen! </b>Notice he didn't say it had to be rectangular or have a position on the screen. It's position is an additional attribute but not needed.
</p>

<p>
Windows that have prebuilt characteristics are very helpful. These are known as Widgets! <b>Widget is simply a window with a gadgets.</b> Yes, widget is a technical term. <b>Gadgets include a border, scrollbars, buttons, a sub-window, etc.</b>
</p>

<p>
Code for widgets is typically provided in collections of widgets. <b>Widget Sets consist of widgets.</b> You might expect a frame, a few buttons, a scrollbar, and many more. The graphics programmer has these things at their disposale. We have more than just widget sets as well. Down below Java deep inside the system code, we can control all kinds of things that aren't easily controlled by Java! We could say, have some object and move another object, there is some question if you move the window on top will you get back what you covered up? Why would you not want to get back what you covered up? <i>It takes computing time.</i> Do we want to buffer stuff before displaying it? Do we want to modify stuff before putting it out? Do we want to change colors? There are numerous levels of abstraction here starting with the widgets at the very top and then down to the system code, machine language, that sends signals out for TCP/IP. It's very complex. It's much easier to use Java here. 
</p>

<p>
Write code to display some image. Make it so when  you click a button or something the object changes color on the basis of... (a firetruck went by and he made Jim face) Change the color based on keyboard. Send him a screenshot as a pdf.
