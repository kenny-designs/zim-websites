Foreword, I hope everyone is doing well! I waited until March 27th to review the last few lectures Gross has posted. It's been a crazy time adapting to online classes and even performing all online exams to boot. May we get through all this unscathed o7
</p>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>
This is the first of Gross' online lectures. Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe!<br>
Click <a href="https://youtu.be/66bthB0tkw4" title="here" class="https">here</a> to watch it.
</p>

<p>
Gross begin's by stating there is much misinformation on the internet about <i>time sharing systems. </i>He also refers to it as a <i>cloud system.</i>
</p>

<p>
Almost nobody mentions GE he mentions. GE Machines. GE became the industry leader in time sharing. Offered two very good time sharing systems (he makes a quip about the Basic language haha nice one prof).
</p>

<p>
Generals apparently didn't believe what GE was doing couldn't work (albeit it did).<br>
They ended up focusing on the scientific community instead. They managed to make their customers happy quite well.
</p>

<p>
Upon looking online, Gross mentions that GE was completely ignored when it comes to time sharing systems. GE was the industry leader and yet <b>nobody</b> is mentioning them.
</p>

<p>
Let us go back in time here. Computerized graphics was understood to be a huge advantage in dealing with aircrafts and whatnot for the military. It wasn't very long until people pushed hard for graphics. <b>And this lead to problems.</b>
</p>

<p>
Early machines were horribly expensive! A single megabyte was expensive as all hell. Plus, you had to rent machines instead of just buying them.
</p>

<p>
Users wanted graphics. They got them but they were horribly expensive!
</p>

<p>
To develop the machines, we start with a box. Let us label it the CPU (which was hella expensive btw). Early CPUs have <b>no</b> input/output capabilities at all! Or it was very limited. Instead they had <b>controller</b> boxes. They were programmable computers that allowed us to have IO. This allowed the CPU to be freed to do whatever it is they do well. Attached to the controller, we had IO devices such as tape drives. Btw, <b>controller boxes were horribly expensive as well!</b> They worked well nonetheless though.
</p>

<p>
Under pressure from customers, it wasn't long until control boxes controlled <b>CRTs </b>(Cathode-ray tube. You know, CRT monitors? I wish I still had mine from childhood...). Once again, <i>it worked.</i> Expensive but it worked! You had graphics! $100,000 was the price for a single CRT though... What could we do about this though?
</p>

<p>
<i>Btw, controllers are still used in the mainframes of today for they can process far more IO than any PC. This is one of the reasons why mainframes ain't dead!</i>
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at how the industry evolved though. One of the important trends was that computers were being used by one person at a time. One of the things IBM did right was the IBM-1620 which was the first fully transisterized computer. Very popular on college campuses and even highschools! Has a few peculuarities though. It has <i>no arithmetic!</i> The codename for the machine was <i>cadet</i> which some people said stood for <i>can't add, doesn't even try!. </i>All airthmetic was done by table lookup (which worked well tbh). However, in practice, programmers would work on their programs for an extended period of time. Most of the time programmers were working with the machine, they were doing nothing (well thinking)! So far as the machine was concerned, they were doing nothing.
</p>

<p>
So then, people began to think: Wow, $1000 bucks a month is kinda a lot to rent a machine. In a response, a guy made a smaller computer and tried to sell it. Instead of calling it a <i>computer</i>, they called it <i>Programmable Data Processors </i>(that way, the big bois like IBM and GE wouldn't absolutely crush them).
</p>

<p>
The PDP-1 hit the market and <b>exploded!</b> Not literally, but as in it got really popular. All of a sudden, you could buy your own computer for less than a months rent on a big machine!
</p>

<p>
Even if you have a cheap machine, letting it sit there idle while the programmer is thinking is <b>not good.</b> It's excessive and costly. The idea grew that, say, we have half a dozen programs. How do we attach half a dozen teletype machines to the CPU, we can give each programmer a small amount of CPU time and switch programmers fast enough, they'll think that they own the machine! While someone is thinking, someone else is computing! This is the heart of the time sharing systems! Also, <i>the pressure for graphics was growing as well!</i>
</p>

<p>
Someone put together a quite capable video terminal. 
</p>

<p>
First of all, digital equipment eleminated the need for controllers! They connected peripherals directly to the CPU. <b>This caused a major reduction in cost right there! </b>This is great for cost is down and everybody had their own machine! Sadly, it wasn't enough. More problems arrised. A small machine like a PDP-1 didn't have much power and <i>people</i> <i>wanted more!</i> 
</p>

<p>
We are now at the 23:07 mark of the video, Gross is taking a moment to switch out the cameras and mentions that time sharing incluenced graphics very, very strongly! (I make a note here because I find graphics programming to be very interesting)
</p>

<p>
Time sharing people figured out that its very easy to communicate with a machine if you use the same input device as you use in the lab. A <b>modem</b> was useful for it converted radio signals to digital signals! However, the damn things clanged, banged, ran through horrendous amounts of paper, and needed the ribbons changed.
</p>

<p>
The race was on to create a new intelligent terminal. Intel decided to pack all of the intelligence needed into a single chip. 
</p>

<p>
The industry was going bonkers! People were taking these new processors and doing all sorts of cute things with them. Treating them like toys! 
</p>

<p>
Altair hired a couple of future Harvard dropouts to write a basic interpreter for the Altaire. This built the foundation for a company to be created called <i>Microsoft.</i>
</p>

<p>
There was a huge pressure for graphics. The toys appeared and some of the toys arranged to attach themselves (the owners at least) to TV sets! If you were clever, you could do graphics with them! Draw pictures instead of just printing characters to a screen. IBM made the PCjr (didn't sell well cause no one wanted to buy a toy) but the XT 370 (which emulated mainframes quite well actually) didn't sell. Business people picked up the PC Junior though. The xt 370 was much better designed and was good for heavy computing. Great for IO which they were designed for.
</p>

<p>
In any case, people said if IBM was doing it then it couldn't be wrong. the PCjr sold and people wanted more! As such, people wanted graphics really, really badly. The company autodesk could supply workstations if you have very deep pockets. We now we have some very successful time sharing systems.
</p>

<p>
Now then, we have access to large comuting resources at reasonable prices, and graphic terminals. <b>Why can't we attach those graphic terminals from far away same as we attach our teletype machines? </b>Why can't attach our graphics to remote machines??? Because of a serious problem: <b>transit time. </b>Since when does the speed of light have anything to do with my computer? You may (probably not) ask? If you want interative graphics, you have to be able to get the signal from the CPU to the graphic terminal quickly enough. 
</p>

<p>
Even in modern processors, we have wait states! That's because it takes time to get from one part of the chip to another. <b>If we're having travel time problems on a tiny little chip, can you imagine what kinds of problems we'd have sending graphics to a terminal hundreds of miles away? </b>That's quite the disaster and we need a way to break this!
</p>

<p>
We have time sharing to give people adequate and cheap computing ability. We have terminals who have the cost driven down by competition. All we don't have is a way to get our signal to get across the gap fast enough! Luckily, there was a solution: <b>the internet!</b> What? Yeah (He says smugly ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)).
</p>

<p>
From terminal to CPU and vice versa, we used the internet to get between the two and fast IBM had a technique for remote connection but it required a dedicated line. A telephone line. It worked but you had to rent a dedicated line. Other manufacturers had similar arrangements. The transfer of data from one place to another was a big issue. <i>The internet provided a solution. </i>Not perfect but good. It works <b>as all of you game players are aware </b>(can we get some poggers in the chat for my dude Gross? GAMERS RISE UP!).
</p>

<p>
To close, we have one big question: <b>how do we get graphics on our machines? And what quality of graphics can we get?</b>
</p>

<p>
The rest of the details can be found on Day 16.
</p>

<p>
He also recommends we do some research on some of these old technologies such as time sharing systems from back in the day. How do we handle running several jobs at the same time? Great stuff there. Be ready to deal with multithreaded programs as well if you wanna do well in the current market.
