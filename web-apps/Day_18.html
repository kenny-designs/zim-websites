<h3>Javascript Introduction</h3>

<p>
I will not lie, I did not expect us to ever learn JS in this web apps class.
</p>

<p>
The first ~15 minutes he talks about the exam and misc. things. At 14:25 he switches over to his JavaScript lecture.
</p>

<p>
<i>Due to our professor's newly found video editing skills, we have skipped time into the future. The artificial light of yesterday is no more. We are met with natural light and my greatest enemy written in somewhat legible text: JavaScript. Have mercy...</i>
</p>

<p>
He flips the giant pages back while remarking how he wishes he had a whiteboard to work with.
</p>

<p>
Our professor could not have written truer words: <b>JavaScript strikes me as a rather sloppy, hodgepodge, of adhoc facilities. Things that have been just tacked on willnilly. It resembles throwing a pile of fruit into a blender that doesn't work very well.</b>
</p>

<p>
I appreciate this analogy.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript was originally invented in an attempt to take over the web as other people were trying to use the Java language. Somewhere in this mess, we got flash which was also an attempt to take over the web (flash thought they could ask for royalties and boy that sure worked out. Note, it did <b>not</b> work out. RIP old newgrounds.)
</p>

<p>
Instead of Java or Flash, we ended up with JavaScript which got its name in a deliberate attempt to confuse the user into believing it had something to do with Java. It's sorta object oriented like Java so there's that. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, we shall be referring to JavaScript with one of its many names: <b>ecmascript.</b> Why? Because that was the name given when people tried to get certification for JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
Now then, JavaScript has many problems which Microsoft tried to solve with TypeScript which adds type checking to JS. 
</p>

<p>
Gross says he'd like to give us a book like he did with Scheme but he hasn't found one. He says to just check out something like w3schools.com (sigh. aw shit here we go again). He likes the w3schools website but admits it's quite fragmented to which I highly agree. 
</p>

<p>
JS is meant for the web but nowadays it's becoming popular to use it off the web too (Node.js anyone?). He's going to limit our discussion for web pages though.
</p>

<p>
He is going to give us a template for a typical web page using JS:
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	functions
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	functions
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
There are many tags but a simple html tag will do. We also have the head tag which we can have the title and all sorts of other metadata. The most important thing you can put in the head <b>is JS functions.</b> Function definitions in the head <b>is good practice.</b> Very helpful for debugging a program. You'll know exactly where to look for them. The head tag is following by the body tag. (The end &lt;/body&gt; tag isn't technically necessary. Browsers are smart enough to know where it ends.)
</p>

<p>
You can also put your functions are the bottom of the body tag as well. However, if you have a lot of code your browser is going to take a while to get to the code. It's gonna take a while before your browser can display anything <i>and that is a problem. </i>
</p>

<p>
Back with time sharing stuff, people asked how long would a user wait for something to load? It was about 5 seconds. Any longer and users get pissed off. If you have a lot of code, it pays to stick your functions at the very bottom of the HTML. That way, the user will have something to look at while the browser interprets the code. 
</p>

<p>
So, <b>stick function definitions in the head</b> or <b>stick them in the bottom of the body.</b> You could stick your code wherever but there are various issues that come with this. It's not good practice to just stick your JS code wherever.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have the basic template of HTML code, let us move on to the script tag.
</p>

<p>
How does the browser know that it's dealing with JS? It uses the script tag! In between the script tag we put JS. When the script tag closes, it's back to regular HTML.
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script&gt;
	javascript
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
For a time, browsers didn't support JavaScript. In fact, some users just disable it! There is a <i>noscript</i> tag we can use to detect if the browser is down to do JS. We can then provide alternative text. Sadly, the code will then display. He's not gonna go into any of this though.
</p>

<p>
Now then, let us go into JS itself. One of the most important facility in JS is <b>comments.</b> There is // and multiline <a href="file:///*" title="/*" class="file">/*</a> */ which we're used to.
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="js">// for single line comments

/*
Multi-
line
comments
*/</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
Remember, <b>if it aint documented it aint! </b>Gross says he did see a documentation issue that is of interest. There is an important simulation of the COVID-19 virus. That model needs some modification. The updating has been seriously delayed because it consists of 1000s of lines of undocumented C code. The updating is delayed now as someone documents it. This is a bloody mess.
</p>

<p>
As mentors back in Gross' time recommends, it's often easier to rewrite code then figure out how undocumented code works (<i>I feel that professor</i>).
</p>

<p>
Given the rate that COVID-19 is moving, speed is of great concern. Document heavily!
</p>

<p>
Now then, let us begin looking at JS proper!
</p>

<p>
As usual, one of the first things we need is a place to put the data that we are going to work with. It needs to be stored internally in memory. As with any <b>imperative</b> language, we use variables. No matter the language, variables need to be declared somehow so that our interpreter/compiler knows. The type of variable, how much space is needed for it, etc. In C++ and Java, we have excplicit declarations. A datatype, a name, and perhaps an initialization. JS gives us something like that <b>but </b>it is very <b>weakly typed</b> and <b>dynamic typed. Variables are given a type on the fly!</b> That type can be changed on the fly too.
</p>

<p>
Assigning a type and compelling an interpreter to keep that type can be a nuisance. The stronger the typing the stronger the enforcement of the rules. Physicists do the same when making calculations for if the resulting type of data is wrong then they know something went awry. 
</p>

<p>
In any case, we have two ways to declare JS variables:
</p>
<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="js">var myvar = 42; // we can use the var keyword
myvar = 3;      // or we could just straight up initialize it like so
myvar = "text"; // we just changed the type! we can do this too
a = b + c;      // or we can just use it in an expression. We just declared a!</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
Despite all the different ways of declaring and initializing variables, it's bad practice to just declare+initialize all willnilly and wherever. <i>Declare it first at the top.</i>
</p>

<p>
Next, we have functions. We are used to declaring functions with a return type, function name, and then an argument list. JS is <i>terribly</i> careless about typing. So, the type of return data is merely a matter of what you actually return. So we don't define what the return type is.
</p>

<p>
We do make use of a function keyword followed by a function name, an argument list, and the body of the function.
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="js">function funcName() {
	// you can declare local variables
	// when we return, they go away
	// we don't really have static variables in JS
	// we instead have global variables.
	// You can declare variables outside any function
	// and they remain indefinitely (messy. Very messy)
	var yourVar;
	return yourVar;
}

// There are a few important functions. Perhaps one of the most important
// is the alert box. The function looks like so:
alert(myString); // takes a single string. It can be multiple lines with \n

// alert is nice for debugging albeit a bit crude</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
We can also debug JS with the web page itself such as making changes to the HTML. The problem is that we have no idea who is doing what. You'll have to dig around but, nonetheless, it is very useful for output.
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="html">&lt;p id="demo"&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	// We can change the HTML just like so:
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "new text";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- We can also include external JS --&gt;
&lt;script src="source.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
When the interpreter gets to line 4 in the above code, it'll change the HTML in the page. 
</p>

<p>
To make these changes, we need to get our grubby wittle paws on something in the page uwu. Use getElementById(). 
</p>

<p>
In the words of Gross, <b>JS is a relatively easy language to learn so long as you don't pay attention to details and good programming practice. </b>lmao nice.
</p>

<h3>Exam on the 14th of April</h3>

<p>
Due to the special circumstances (aka COVID-19) the exam itself will be operating under special circumstances. He urges us to not cheat and trusts us enough that he won't employ what is essentially spyware to watch us.
</p>

<p>
The exam itself is 'sorta online.' He will provide us two copies of the exam. A plain text version that he wants us to edit with our answers. He will also give us a nicely formatted pdf as well. 
</p>

<p>
He says ignore tags such as {\tt. There will also be a version of the exam at Gross' website here.
</p>

<p>
As of writing, I connect seem to connect to his website which would be the following:<br>
www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~magross/
</p>

<p>
There is a junk.txt file on his site we can reference.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the exam, we'll have files named exam.txt and exam.pdf.
</p>

<p>
<b>The exam will will begin at the start of a normal class which is 11pm. </b>The exam should take about 40-45 minutes. You have an hour to complete it. He demands that we email him our results by the end of the hour. Do not test his patience by submitting a bit late! Don't bother modify the clock or anything on your machine. He will be referring to the time stamps by the email servers which we have no control over.
</p>

<p>
He says we can simply fill out the exam.txt within the email itself. He recommends we practice this a bit so we don't mess up on the exam itself.
