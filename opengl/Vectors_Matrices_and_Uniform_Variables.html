<p>
As for the actual coding, we will be using a library called GLM. However, it's incredibly helpful to understand some of what is happening behind the scenes.
</p>

<h3>Vectors</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>A vector is a quantity with magnitude (length) and direction.
<ul>
<li>In other words, how far something is and in what direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be used for lots of th ings, normally to represent a direction, or something's position (e.g. how far and in what direction something is, relative to a certain point).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Vector Addition</h3>

<p>
Vector <b>v</b> = (1, 2, 3) for example where x=1, y=2, and z=3.<br>
We can add and subtract vectors.<br>
(1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6) = (5, 7, 9)<br>
(1, 2, 3) - (4, 5, 6) = (-3, -3, -3)
</p>

<h3>Vector Multiplication</h3>

<p>
We can multiply vectors by a scalar value. A scalar value in this case is a single value.<br>
5 * (1, 2, 3) = (5, 10, 15)
</p>

<p>
Visually, this just extends the length of the vector in the same direction. Negative values have it reverse direction.
</p>

<p>
What if we want to multiply one vector by another? Well, that's hard to define visually and we don't really do it very often if at all. Instead, we make use of the <b>Dot Product!</b>
</p>

<h3>Dot Product</h3>

<p>
Also known as the <b>Scalar Product</b> because it returns a scalar vaue (single value) as opposed to a vector.<br>
There are two ways to calculate the dot product:<br>
The first way looks like this: <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation.png">
</p>

<p>
The second way looks like this: <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation001.png"><br>
|v<sub>1</sub>| is the <i>magnitude</i> or the <i>length</i> of v<sub>1</sub>.<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation002.png"> is the angle between v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>
The dot product is quite amazing! It can be used to help with reflections, collision detection, checking where objects are in relation to eachother, the angle between them, etc.
</p>

<h3>Magnitude</h3>

<p>
Vectors are right-angle triangles.<br>
As such, we can calculate magnitude with a variation of the <i>Pythagorean Theorem!</i><br>
In 3D, it's just: <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation003.png"><br>
This formula essentially gives us the longest side of our vector which is the vector itself!
</p>

<h3>Dot Product Angle</h3>

<p>
Now that we know how the dot product works and magnitude, we can use this information to obtain the angle between two vectors!<br>
Once again, remember this formula: <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation001.png"><br>
So, we know how to calculate v<sub>1</sub> * v<sub>2</sub>. With this, we have the following:<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation004.png">
</p>

<p>
Remember, theta is our angle! To get it, we just use arccos.<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation005.png">
</p>

<p>
This will be very useful when we learn about lighting!
</p>

<p>
<img src="./images/dot-product-visualized.png">
</p>

<p>
What that diagram essentially says is if we project <b>a</b> along <b>b</b> then that is how far along we are. <br>
<b>b</b> is a unit vector by the way! A <b>unit vector</b> is a vector with a magnitude of 0.<br>
The dot product is also quite helpful in determining if two vectors are right-angles of one another!
</p>

<h3>Unit Vector</h3>

<p>
At times, we may only want to know a direction and how to advance in that direction.<br>
A <b>unit vector</b> is a vector with magnitude (length) of just 1.<br>
How do we get a unit vector from some vector though? Well, just divide a vector by it's magnitude! Let <b>u </b>be a unit vector and <b>v</b> be some vector. Then we have the following: <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation006.png"><br>
The end result is a vector <b>u</b> that has the same direction as the vector <b>v</b> but is only <b>one unit in magnitude!</b>
</p>

<h3>Cross Product</h3>

<p>
Only really works in 3D.<br>
The cross product creates a new vector that is at a right angle to two other vectors.<br>
Perhaps best to show an image of what is going on here:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./images/cross-product.png">
</p>

<p>
Notice that order is indeed important!<br>
Since we can get a right angle, it can be useful to determine which way something is facing or dealing with normals.
</p>

<h3>Matrices</h3>

<p>
Matrices consist of a group of values in an i * j grid.<br>
For example: a 2x3 matrix that has 2 rows and 3 columns. Remember, we use <b>rows and then columns!</b><br>
i = rows<br>
j = columns<br>
Can be used for all sorts of things across grphics, game development, and scientific fields.<br>
We will use them to handle model transforms (translation, rotation, scaling), projections, and view.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Addition and Subtraction</h3>

<p>
<b>Scalar: </b>Just add/subtract value from each element, much like with vectors.<br>
<b>Matrix: </b>Add the values on a per-element basis. Each one matches to its own position in the other matrix.<br>
With that in mind, <b>the dimensions of two matrices must match for addition/subtraction!</b>
</p>

<p>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation007.png">
</p>

<p>
In a way, we are just overlaying one matrix over the other. We actually don't add matrices too often but there we go!
</p>

<h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<p>
<b>Scalar: </b>Just multiply value with each element, much like with vectors.<br>
<b>Matrix:</b> Things are a bit more complex...
</p>

<p>
Firstly, <b>order matters!</b> Matrices are not commutative!<br>
Secondly, the columns on the left-hand matrix <b>must equal</b> the number of Rows on the right-hand matrix. So, a 2x3 matrix can be multiplied by a 3x5 matrix. However, a 2x3 matrix times a 2x3 matrix wouldn't work! Why? the left matrix has 3 columns and the right matrix has 2 rows. 3 != 2 so we can't multiply them.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, we will be using 4x4 matrices in graphics programming.
</p>

<p>
It's a bit difficult to explain how to perform the multiplication so here's a photo:<br>
<img src="./images/matrix-multiplication.png">
</p>

<p>
Notice, <b>we just do a dot product on overlapping rows and columns!</b> That's all it is! For each row in the left-hand matrix, we find the dot product between it and the corresponding column in the right-hand matrix. The result in the picture gives us a 2x2 matrix! So, we won't always have a resulting matrix of the same size.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the GLM library will handle all of this matrix math for us! So we won't have to do any of it by hand unless you plan on writing your own math library or doing something of that sort.
</p>

<h3>Matrices and Vectors</h3>

<p>
So then, you may have noticed that we can write vectors as <img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation008.png">. This is important for it's just a <b>matrix with a single column!</b><br>
This is great for we can easily multiply a 4x4 matrix by a 4x1 vector to receive a single 4x1 vector!<br>
When multiplying, our vectors will always be to the right of our matrices.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Transforms</h3>

<p>
Matrices can be used with vectors to apply  transforms to them (translation, rotation, scaling...).<br>
Most basic is the <b>Identity Matrix</b>. It looks like this:<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation009.png">
</p>

<p>
The identity matrix merely just returns the given vector!<br>
The identitiy matrix is a good starting point for applying other transformations.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Transforms: Translation</h3>

<p>
Translation essentially just <i>moves</i> a vector.<br>
Use it for changing the position of something!<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation010.png">
</p>

<p>
Notice how that 1 in the vector allows us to add the X, Y, and Z into the vector.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Transforms: Scaling</h3>

<p>
Scaling <i>resizes</i> a vector.<br>
Can be used to increase a distance by a factor, or more commonly, to make an object larger.<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation011.png">
</p>

<p>
We don't usually scale too often in practice.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Transforms: Rotation</h3>

<p>
Rotation rotates a vector.<br>
Should be thought of as <b>rotating around its origin</b>...<br>
So to choose a point of rotation, translate the vector so the point to rotate around is at the origin.
</p>

<p>
There are three different matrices for handling rotation! One for x, another for y, and one for z.<br>
<b>The angles are in radians by the way!</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>X Rotation:</b><br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation012.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>Y Rotation:</b><br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation013.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>Z Rotation:</b><br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation014.png">
</p>

<p>
This is quite a lot to take in and, luckily, we don't have to remember all of this! GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) will do most of the matrix math for us. Even still, it does help to know what's going on here.
</p>

<h3>Matrix Transforms: Combining</h3>

<p>
Perhaps we wish to perform a translation and a scale to a vector? Well, we can by combining out matrices! Observe the following:<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation016.png">
</p>

<p>
The resulting matrix above will scale our vector by 2 and translate it 1 along the x, 2 along the y, and 3 along the z.
</p>

<p>
To apply this matrix, we do the following:<br>
<img src="./Vectors_Matrices_and_Uniform_Variables/equation015.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>Remember! </b>The order we combine matrices in does matter! Transforms happen in reverse order so when we combined our translation and scaling matrices above we first apply the scaling and then the translation. In that way, our matrices are combined <b>from right to left!</b><br>
If we swapped our translation and scaling matrix, then translation would be applied follwed by scaling. So the scale would also scale the transform!
</p>

<h3>Uniform Variables</h3>

<p>
A <b>uniform variable</b> is a type of variable in a shader (y'know, in GLSL code.<br>
Uniforms are values global to the shader that aren't associated with a particular vertex.
</p>

<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="cg">#version 330

in vec3 pos;

uniform mat4 model;

void main()
{
	gl_Position = model * vec4(pos, 1.0);
}</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
The <i>in</i> data changes on a per-vertex basis. However, a uniform is constant and global! It won't be changing for every single vertex that gets passed through the shader. This is useful for when we, say, want to move a bunch of vertices 10 units on the x axis. 
</p>

<p>
Each uniform has a location ID in the shader.<br>
Need to find the location so we can bind a value to it.
</p>
<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="cpp">int location = glGetUniformLocation(shaderID, "uniformVarName");</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can bind a value to that location.
</p>
<div class="zim-object">
<pre><code class="cpp">glUniform1f(location, 3.5f);</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Make sure you have set the appropriate shader program to be in use!
</p>

<p>
There are different variable types:<br>
glUniform1f - Single floating value<br>
glUniform1i - SIngle integer value<br>
glUniform4f - vec4 of floating values<br>
glUniform4fv - vec4 of floating values, value specified by pointer<br>
glUniformMatrix4fv - mat4 of floating values, value specified by pointer<br>
etc...
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Vectors are directions and positions in space.</li>
<li>Matrices are 2-dimensional arrays of data used for calculating transforms and various other functions.</li>
<li>Vectors are a type of matrix and can have these functions applied to them.</li>
<li>The order of a transform operations matters!</li>
<li>Last matrix operation applied happens first.</li>
<li>GLM is used to handle matrix calculations.</li>
<li>Uniform variables pass global data to shaders.</li>
<li>Need to obtain a uniform's location then bind data to it.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Extra Notes</h3>

<p>
An <b>attribute variable</b> is distinct for each vertex that is pass through the shader.<br>
A uniform variable on the other hand is constant throughout the whole thing.
